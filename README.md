# facerecognitionattendancesystem
The Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python project developed to automate the process of taking attendance by using facial recognition technology. It offers a convenient and efficient solution for tracking attendance in various settings such as schools, colleges, and workplaces.

The project utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize and identify individuals based on their facial features. It employs the OpenCV library to capture live video from a webcam or camera device. The captured video frames are then processed using the dlib library, which extracts facial landmarks and encodes the unique features of each face.
